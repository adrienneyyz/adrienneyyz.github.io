                <p>Is it just me, or does it seem like everyone you know is having a baby? As a chiropractor and a mother, I have a special interest in pre and postnatal care. The body experiences many drastic changes during the nine months of pregnancy, labour, and post-pregnancy and there are many things your Chiropractor can do to help keep you comfortable and pain free.  There are no known indications for spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) throughout pregnancy, and your practitioner will be fully trained on how to modify treatment to suit your comfort<span class="super">1</span>. In fact there are many Chiropractors that actually specialize in pre and postnatal care. In addition, Chiropractors are huge proponents of preventative medicine, and can advise you on safe exercises for you to do while your pregnant or even with your baby after. In the July 2011 issue of OCA News, Dr. Jon Barrett an OBGYN at Sunnybrook Hospital discussed how pleased he was when recommending chiropractic intervention during pregnancy, “Chiropractic and medicine, we haven’t always been on the same page or spoken the same language. But physicians aren’t very good at fixing disorders of muscular balance and spinal issues. That’s what chiropractors learn about and know about. I’m really excited about this opportunity we have to work together to help our patients.”<span class="super">2</span></p>

                <p>So if you are like me and you have a friend (or a million friends) that is currently pregnant or new moms tell them to go see a Chiropractor! In the mean time, here is some information and helpful tips you can share:</p>

                <ol class="article-list">
                    <li>1. First of all, exercise is encouraged within your limit during a healthy pregnancy. It’s usually advised that you may continue what you were doing before you became pregnant, concluding the better shape you are in before you get pregnant the better. Staying in good fitness throughout your pregnancy will most likely help with comfort and energy levels; and help you bounce back quicker post pregnancy.  Dr. Weiss a lecturer and researcher at CMCC have a special interest in exercise and pregnant women. Her current research is looking at whether the thickness of a woman’s abdominal muscles is a factor in the prediction pregnancy related back pain.  She believes this may be essential for the prevention of pain during pregnancy<span class="super">2</span>. Imagine being able to pregnancy discomfort by utilizing a few simple core exercises?</li>

                    <li>2. If you would prefer to avoid taking any pain medication during pregnancy, a chiropractic adjustment can offer relief from pain caused by the increased lower back curve, pelvic changes, and postural adaptation. When during your pregnancy is chiropractic safe? Anytime. Many mothers even claim that chiropractic helps with morning sickness/ nausea they experienced throughout pregnancy!</li>

                    <li>3. After pregnancy there are many simple, repetitive tasks that can easily cause strain in the body. For example, lifting that little bundle out of the crib. Although a baby may feel light, poor lifting mechanics can easily cause strain in your low back; especially after pregnancy when you are not at full strength. Keep in mind the further away your baby is from you when you pick him/her up, the more strain on your back. If your crib lowers at the front this makes it easier to get into the appropriate position to lift the baby. Regardless of if the crib lowers or not, bring your baby closest to you in the crib first before bending at the knees (not hinging at the waist) and lifting.  Many people mistakenly find it hard to believe that a tiny baby could cause any stress on your spine, but bending forward to pick up your child from a seated position or reaching and lifting the child away from your body can increase the weight of pressure on your spine up to 3-10 times!<span class="super">3</span> I would also advise to hold a car seat close to your body with both hands, rather than dangling on one forearm leaning to the side to compensate for the weight being carried.  Another common cause of back pain for new moms. </li>

                    <li>4. As soon as you get the ok from a medical professional, make your very best effort to try and fit in  exercises. There are many simple core exercises you can do for a few minutes each day at home; pelvic floor exercises are especially important post pregnancy. There are really great classes for Mom & Baby, also a great way to meet new moms. A healthy support system can also serve as a motivator to become more active, taking walks together or taking a stroller fit class together can be fun, and great for your health!</li>
