                <p>This blog was created to try and spread the word about the amazing and varied benefits of Chriopractic care, and to try and create a larger outlet to disseminate information to our current and future patients. It’s collaboration, and has many contributors including DC’s, educators, other healthcare professionals, and students. We hope to be able to utilize social media platforms to encourage the sharing of current interesting research in chiropractic, health, fitness and nutrition; helpful tips and resources, and interesting stories rooted in health and wellness. Please feel free to share with family and friends!</p>
