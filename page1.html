                    Acute repetitive lumbar syndrome: A multi-component insight into the disorder

                <p>With the chiropractic profession finding itself at a crossroads with respect to its identity we sometimes find ourselves unsure of what we’re really good at. We get caught in the battle of whether chiropractors are ‘back pain specialists’ or more of a ‘wellness’ type of practitioner. I think that we’re both of these – there are many areas we can specialize in and make a large difference for people.</p>

                <p>With respect to an article by Moshe Solomonow, it becomes evident in the study that high cyclic loading frequency is a very real thing in many peoples daily lives, particularly depending on one’s profession. High loading rates and high velocity of motion are some of the most significant risk factors for repetitive lumbar injury (RLI). RLI is a complex multifactorial syndrome and can greatly affect one’s quality of daily living. It is unavoidable that our tissues undergo significant creep in our daily lives/jobs. As a result of this, we get inflammation of the viscoelastic tissues of the lumbar spine, leading to tissue failure and degradation. This is an area in which we can effectively contribute to improving quality of life by implementing activity modifications to help people protect themselves. Mosche Solomonow includes that there is evidence supporting certain types of spinal manipulation to reduce cytokine expression in the blood, thereby, reducing inflammation.</p>

                <p>It can be concluded from this brief discussion that chiropractic can address with expertise, issues such as acute low back pain; as well as greater issues with respect to lifestyle and activity modifications to prevent further problems. In this way, we can see how perhaps we’re not exclusively ‘back pain specialists’ or ‘wellness doctors’, but rather a combination that can address both acute issues and preventative strategies to achieve a better quality of life all around. See you next week!</p>
