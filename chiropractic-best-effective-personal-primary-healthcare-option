                    Chiropractic as the best, most effective, and personal primary healthcare option
                </div>
                <div class="author">Kelsey A. Nissen – 2nd year CMCC student</div>

                <p>Without being as healthy as you can be, how will it be possible to carry out life sustaining yourself and your family? To finally complete that marathon or fitness goal that you have forever dreamed of? Or, put simply, how will it be possible for you to live the best, most comfortable life you can possibly live?</p>

                <p>To give some insight into what is involved in the work of Chiropractors for those who don’t know, they treat individuals of all ages, and they can have an positive effect on various musculoskeletal and nervous system conditions from head to toe; as well as the symptoms of patients experiencing other conditions. They spend time getting to know their patients and work closely with other healthcare professionals to give each patient the absolute best treatment possible. Chiropractors also treat those who are absent of symptoms or ailments, simply to continue preventative care and improve quality of life.  They have a vast knowledge of all aspects of heath, including nutrition and exercise.</p>

                <p>Although many who misunderstand the chiropractic treatment believe that it is simply “back cracking”, it goes far beyond that. Chiropractic has long proven it’s benefits for those with musculoskeletal issues, but for some reason a large majority of the population needs remains in the dark about the benefits, or are even unsure of what a Chiropractor is! Thus,  I have decided to gather the thoughts of various professions and individuals involved in the healthcare field to be able to share how they feel about Chiropractic.</p>

                <p>Andrew O’Brien, a 2nd year medical student at Memorial University in Newfoundland, began with great emphasis on the importance of inter-professional health care management stating that “the best patient care and outcomes result from the cooperative leadership of various professional practitioners. Without doubt, I believe chiropractic to be very valuable within the inter-disciplinary domain of health care practice”. He also believes that chiropractic is able to provide professional, safe, adequate, and knowledgeable care to patients in order to help improve their quality of life and overall health status”.</p>

                <p>The Assistant Professor in Anatomy and Histology department as well as a Coordinator of Special Projects at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College, Dr. Sovak gave his personal thoughts on Chiropractic in the healthcare field stating that, “Chiropractic is a good profession. It can save a lot of money to the healthcare- specifically with issues related to the spine.” Although other professions such as physiotherapy are beginning to utilize the, once native to chiropractic, spinal manipulations Dr. Sovak emphasized that the more highly trained in all areas our healthcare professionals are the more the patient benefits. Chiropractors, especially those in training at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic college believe in this patient-centered model of health. Lastly, Dr. Sovak highlighted an the importance of the doctor- patient relationship, he believes that Chiropractors in particular are one of the best practitioners when it comes to taking time with a patient and really getting to know them to better service their overall health. He enjoys this, what he calls an old-school approach that reminds him of, “the old type of GP- he knew you, he came to you on his bicycle, and this is what I see in a chiropractor.” Mind you, to Dr. Sovak’s first point- if more people utilized their Chiropractor more often as their primary health care provider for MSK issues, this could offer some relief to the over-crowded, traditional Medial Doctor route or care.</p>

                <p>Dr. Giuliano, a chiropractor himself as well as the Educational Coordinator in the Sim Lab, at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College shared some ideas with Dr. Sovak noting that chiropractors,  “should strive to be the leading experts of spine care”. Of course that being said he also followed up with, “we should know the literature, the best evidence that is out there, the implementation of a plan of care for our patients and finally the delivery of that spinal care”. Research and evidenced based care is something that is strongly emphasized in most Chiropractic school, especially here at CMCC. Speaking  from years of  clinical experience, Dr. Giuliano has seen, first hand, how chiropractic can improve symptoms, fix problems, and improve lifestyle stating, “I absolutely know that chiropractic care is effective.  This is not just a personal opinion but one that is supported and continually renewed by the research evidence”. Another extremely important thing to take note of is that as chiropractors, we want to integrate with other professions to ensure each patient is receiving optimal care. Dr. Giuliano supports this mentality,  “we as a profession should strive to be fully integrated within the entire health care spectrum for the delivery of care.  I would love to see our profession fully integrated into a IPE educating system, that is, I would like to have all of our students studying and learning within the same institutions as all other health care professions (medicine, physiotherapy, dentistry, naturopaths, etc.) so that we are all learning about, with, and from each profession”.</p>

                <p>It is extremely exciting to see where the future of chiropractic is headed! Although there are still individuals that have not yet decided to experience the benefits of chiropractic care, each day an increasing number are realizing the touted benefits. In general these days, society wants to be active participants in their healthcare, in the information age patients are more informed and it only makes sense that as healthcare providers we should band together to offer the best and well-rounded patient care we could possible offer. It is also very exciting to know that current Medical students are thrilled at the idea that we should all work together, the divide that was once well known between allopathic care and alternative forms of care is quickly dissipating; all in the name of better patient care.</p>
